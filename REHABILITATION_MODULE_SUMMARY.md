# REHABILITATION MODULE - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## FILES CREATED

### 1. Python Module Files (COMPLETE)

**rehabilitation/__init__.py** - Empty module initializer  
**rehabilitation/apps.py** - App configuration  
**rehabilitation/models.py** - 6 complete models (480 lines):
- RehabilitationConsultation (auto-number: REHAB-0000001)
- PhysicalAssessment (OneToOne with consultation)
- RehabilitationPlan (auto-number: PLAN-0000001)
- RehabilitationSession (auto-number: SES-0000001)
- ExercisePrescription  
- ProgressMeasurement

**rehabilitation/views.py** - All views complete (603 lines):
- rehabilitation_dashboard
- consultation_list, consultation_create, consultation_detail
- physical_assessment_create
- plan_list, plan_create, plan_detail
- session_list, session_create, session_detail
- exercise_list, exercise_create
- progress_measurement_create

**rehabilitation/admin.py** - 6 model admin classes registered
**rehabilitation/urls.py** - Complete URL patterns with UUID parameters

### 2. Templates Needed (11 HTML files)

You need to create these templates in `templates/rehabilitation/`:

1. **dashboard.html** - Stats cards + tables (consultations, sessions, active plans)
2. **consultation_list.html** - Paginated list with filters
3. **consultation_form.html** - Create consultation form  
4. **consultation_detail.html** - Show consultation + link to create assessment/plan
5. **physical_assessment_form.html** - Complete assessment form
6. **plan_list.html** - Paginated plans  
7. **plan_form.html** - Create plan from consultation
8. **plan_detail.html** - Show plan + exercises table + progress + sessions
9. **session_list.html** - Paginated sessions
10. **session_form.html** - Create session from plan
11. **session_detail.html** - Complete session view

### Template Pattern to Follow

All templates should:
- Extend 'base.html'
- Use Bootstrap 5 classes
- Use bi bi-* icons (Bootstrap Icons)
- Include filters/search bars for list views
- Use pagination for lists
- Show status badges (scheduled/completed/cancelled/active)
- Include back buttons and action buttons
- Follow the same structure as psychology/dentistry/ophthalmology modules

### 3. Installation Steps

To activate the module:

1. Add to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:
   'rehabilitation.apps.RehabilitationConfig',

2. Add to main urls.py:
   path('rehabilitation/', include('rehabilitation.urls')),

3. Run migrations:
   python manage.py makemigrations rehabilitation
   python manage.py migrate rehabilitation

4. Create templates (copy structure from psychology module)

5. Add to navigation menu in base template
